      <p>
        I’m <strong>John Campbell</strong>, and this is my personal brand experiment:
        a playful, disruptive piece of cookware designed to hold and crisp tater tots
        like a bunch of grapes on a vine. This brand is my canvas for exploring
        strategic positioning, storytelling, and digital marketing in action.

  <section id="brand">
    <h2>Brand Story & Strategic Positioning</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      This section explains how the Tater Tot Chandelier™ functions as a
      personal brand and a marketing case study, especially in the emerging
      digital marketplace.
    </p>

    <div class="card grid-2">

        <h3>What Is the Tater Tot Chandelier™?</h3>
        <p>
          The Tater Tot Chandelier™ is a cookware concept that turns a simple
          comfort food into a visually striking centerpiece. Imagine a cluster
          of metal “vines” shaped like grapes, each holding perfectly crisp tater
          tots for serving at parties, game nights, or family gatherings.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s fun. It’s functional. And it’s designed for a world where
          <strong>visual shareability</strong> and <strong>unique experiences</strong>
          drive consumer interest.
        </p>
        <h3>My Unique Selling Proposition (USP)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Transforms everyday food into a conversation piece.</li>
          <li>Optimized for social sharing and visual content (photos, reels, shorts).</li>
          <li>Blends product design, entertainment, and personal branding.</li>
          <li>Demonstrates creative thinking and strategic market positioning.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Digital Positioning</h3>
        <p class="tagline">
          In a digital marketplace defined by attention, this brand is built to be remembered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tater Tot Chandelier™ sits at the intersection of
          <strong>novelty</strong>, <strong>storytelling</strong>, and
          <strong>digital-first marketing</strong>. It’s intentionally designed
          to be “thumb-stopping” in feeds and highly shareable, making it ideal
          for platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a digital marketer, I use this concept to show how I think about
          disruptive products, brand personality, and a <em>business-to-individual (B2I)</em>
          approach—where experiences are tailored to the tastes and identities of each consumer.

      <h3>How a Tater Tot Chandelier Became My Digital Marketing Power Move</h3>
      <p>
        When I was challenged to create a personal brand that reflects who I am
        as a marketer, I knew one thing: it had to be <strong>original</strong>,
        <strong>visual</strong>, and a little bit unexpected. The Tater Tot
        Chandelier™ was my answer—a whimsical yet strategic concept that turns a
        familiar comfort food into a centerpiece designed for the digital age.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where brands compete for a fraction of a second of attention,
        products that are instantly recognizable and visually interesting have a
        major advantage. The Tater Tot Chandelier™ does more than hold food;
        it tells a story. That story becomes the foundation for branding,
        content, and digital campaigns.
      </p>

      <h3>My Strategic Positioning as a Candidate</h3>
      <p>
        If I were sitting across from a hiring manager for a marketing role,
        this is how I would present myself using this brand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Creator of Disruptive Ideas:</strong>
          The Tater Tot Chandelier™ demonstrates that I don’t just follow trends;
          I design concepts that can start conversations and generate attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Digital-First Mindset:</strong>
          I think in terms of social media shareability, content formats, and
          user journeys—from the first time someone sees the product in their feed
          to the moment they show it off at a party.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer-Centered Thinking:</strong>
          I consider how individuals—at the level of a “cohort of one”—connect with
          products emotionally and socially, aligning with emerging B2I (business-to-individual)
          strategies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strategic Communicator:</strong>
          I like to explain complex digital trends in approachable language, whether
          I’m talking about AI-driven personalization, pricing models, or global
          e-commerce shifts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Digital Trends Behind the Brand</h3>
      <p>
        The idea behind this brand is informed by several important trends in
        digital marketing. The rise of <strong>precision targeting</strong> and
        <strong>AI-driven personalization</strong> allows marketers to tailor
        product messages to individual interests (Kannan &amp; Li, 2017).
        A highly visual, unusual product like the Tater Tot Chandelier™ fits
        perfectly into a landscape where consumers discover products through
        short-form videos, influencer content, and algorithmic recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, as the digital marketplace evolves, we see more emphasis
        on <strong>value-based experiences</strong> rather than just price.
        Even something as light-hearted as a tater tot centerpiece can provide
        value by making gatherings more memorable, more photogenic, and more fun.
        Those emotional and social benefits often drive willingness to share,
        recommend, and ultimately purchase (Chaffey &amp; Ellis-Chadwick, 2022).

      <h3>Translating the Brand into Real-World Marketing Skills</h3>
      <p>
        This project is more than a theoretical exercise. It represents the way
        I would approach marketing for any product:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a bold, clear concept that stands out in the attention economy.</li>
        <li>Build a story around the product that ties into lifestyle and identity.</li>
        <li>Use digital tools—SEO, social media, analytics—to amplify the message.</li>
        <li>Continuously learn from data, feedback, and user behavior.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As I continue through this course, I will use this brand to practice
        web analytics, search engine optimization, content planning, and
        performance measurement. In doing so, I’m not just imagining a product—I’m
        actively training myself to think and operate like a modern digital marketer.
      </p>

      <h3>Takeaway: Why This Brand Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the Tater Tot Chandelier™ is a reminder that marketing is
        about more than selling. It’s about <strong>creating meaning</strong>,
        <strong>sparking emotion</strong>, and <strong>designing experiences</strong>
        that people remember. By building and promoting this brand, I’m not only
        developing a fun concept—I’m also building and testing my own personal
        brand as a creative, strategic, and digitally fluent marketer.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Call to action:</strong> Follow along as I evolve this brand with
        real digital marketing tactics—search optimization, analytics, and social
        storytelling—throughout the course.

    <!-- BLOG POST 2 -->
    <article class="card blog-body" id="post2" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
      <div class="meta">
        Published by <strong>John Campbell</strong> • Product Development Journey
      </div>

      <h3>The Complete Journey: Bringing the Totelier™ From Idea to Launch</h3>
      <p>
        This blog post documents the full roadmap for transforming the Totelier™—a grape-cluster-inspired
        crisping rack—into a real, manufacturable product ready for launch.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Concept Development & Early Sketches</h3>
      <p>
        The journey started with a simple idea: suspend tater tots in a way that showcased them as both food and design.
        The chandelier concept evolved into a more organic, grape-cluster silhouette, supported by quick sketches and
        inspiration from vines, clusters, and sculptural cookware.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Digital Renderings & Product Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        Next, I created and refined digital renderings of the Totelier™. These visuals helped define the curvature of
        the central vine, the branching structure, the number of prongs, and where decorative leaves should sit.
        Renderings also ensured that the design was not just beautiful, but practical to manufacture and use in real kitchens.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Engineering Blueprint & Specifications</h3>
      <p>
        With the visuals in place, I translated the concept into an engineering blueprint. This includes exact measurements
        for height, width, base diameter, rod diameters, prong length and angle, weld locations, and overall capacity
        (roughly 22–26 tater tots). These specifications turn a creative idea into something a manufacturer can actually build.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Provisional Patent Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        To protect the unique combination of vine-inspired form and functional crisping, I prepared a provisional patent outline.
        It covers the vine-shaped central stem, branching arms, individual prongs for small food items, a weighted base, and
        the dual purpose of cooking and display. This step sets up the ability to move forward with “patent pending” status.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Manufacturer Sourcing & Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        The next phase involves sourcing manufacturers who can handle CNC rod bending, TIG welding, and food-grade stainless steel work.
        Early prototypes will validate heat distribution, stability, ease of cleaning, and compatibility with common ovens and air fryers.
        Based on testing, I’ll refine the design for both form and function.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Branding & Identity Development</h3>
      <p>
        While the hardware is being engineered, I’m building out the Totelier™ brand. The identity balances playful creativity with
        a premium culinary feel. This includes the name, logo concepts, color palette, typography, and messaging that focus on
        “culinary sculpture” and “snack time elevated.”
      </p>

      <h3>7. Packaging Design</h3>
      <p>
        Packaging must communicate what the product is in seconds: a vertical, grape-cluster-style crisping rack for tots and appetizers.
        I’m designing a box that features high-quality images, feature icons, usage instructions, and a concise brand story.
        The visual style ties back to the brand’s vine and vineyard inspirations.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Amazon Listing & E-Commerce Setup</h3>
      <p>
        For launch, Amazon is a key channel. I’m preparing SEO-optimized titles, bullet points, detailed descriptions, and backend search terms.
        I’m also planning an A+ content layout with lifestyle imagery, benefit-driven graphics, and a clear explanation of how Totelier™
        solves the “uneven crisping” problem for small snacks.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Social Media & Viral Marketing Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        The Totelier™ is inherently photogenic, which makes it perfect for short-form content. I’ll create and collaborate on TikTok and
        Instagram Reels showing people loading the rack with tots, watching them crisp, and serving them as a dramatic centerpiece.
        The goal is to position the product as both functional and fun—something you’d want to show off at gatherings.
      </p>

      <h3>10. First Production Run & Quality Control</h3>
      <p>
        Once the prototype is finalized, I’ll green-light the first production run. This stage includes thorough quality checks:
        weld strength, surface finishing, alignment of prongs, and packaging durability. I want every unit to feel solid, polished,
        and worthy of its role as both cookware and table art.
      </p>

      <h3>11. Fulfillment & Logistics</h3>
      <p>
        To support smooth delivery, I’ll connect production with Amazon FBA and potentially a third-party logistics provider.
        This ensures consistent shipping times, inventory tracking, and scalability as interest grows. Good logistics are just as
        important as good design when you’re trying to build a real product business.
      </p>

      <h3>12. Official Launch & Iteration</h3>
      <p>
        Launch will involve coordinated timing between Amazon listing activation, influencer posts, paid ads, and social media content.
        After release, I’ll watch reviews, messages, and analytics closely to learn how customers use the Totelier™, what they love,
        and what could be improved. That feedback will help shape future versions, accessories, and even new product ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Follow along</strong> as I continue to refine, test, manufacture, and bring the Totelier™ to market.
        This journey is about more than one product—it’s a live case study in turning a creative concept into a tangible business.

    <!-- BLOG POST 3 (NEW: Google Ads Campaign as separate blog post) -->
    <article class="card blog-body" id="post3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
      <div class="meta">
        Published by <strong>John Campbell</strong> • Google Ads / Paid Search Campaign
      </div>

      <h3>Google Ads Campaign for Totelier™ (Paid Search Plan)</h3>
      <p>
        As Totelier™ evolves from a concept into a launch-ready product, the largest challenge is discoverability.
        A tabletop “charcuterie chandelier” is visually unique, but shoppers often search using more familiar,
        intent-based phrases such as “charcuterie centerpiece,” “party serving stand,” or “unique charcuterie display.”
        A Google Ads campaign helps Totelier™ appear at the exact moment customers are searching for those solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>What Google Ads Are (Terminology Included)</h3>
      <p>
        Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) is Google’s paid advertising platform that lets brands display ads across
        Google Search results (and optionally the Display Network and YouTube). Advertisers bid on <strong>keywords</strong>,
        and many campaigns use <strong>CPC (cost-per-click)</strong> pricing, meaning costs occur when someone clicks an ad.
        Performance is tracked using <strong>impressions</strong>, <strong>CTR (click-through rate)</strong>,
        <strong>conversions</strong>, and <strong>Quality Score</strong>. In combination, bid and Quality Score influence
        <strong>Ad Rank</strong> (where the ad appears on the page).
      </p>

      <h3>Why Paid Search Matters (Role + Pillars of Success)</h3>
      <p>
        Paid search captures high-intent users—people actively looking to buy or compare products. It also provides immediate
        visibility while organic SEO grows over time. The pillars of Google Ad success include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Relevant keywords</strong> aligned to how customers actually search</li>
        <li><strong>Compelling ad copy</strong> that clearly explains the value proposition</li>
        <li><strong>Landing page experience</strong> that matches intent and builds trust quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Score</strong> improvement through relevance and user experience</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing optimization</strong> based on performance data</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Keyword Research (How I Choose the Right Keywords)</h3>
      <p>
        For Totelier™, keyword selection is based on relevance, search intent, and conversion likelihood. I would use
        Google Keyword Planner and Google Trends to validate demand and discover related terms. Example target keywords include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>charcuterie centerpiece</li>
        <li>party serving stand</li>
        <li>unique charcuterie display</li>
        <li>wine night accessories</li>
        <li>entertaining serving tray</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Campaign Setup Example (Account + Targeting + Budget)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Campaign Type:</strong> Search (primary campaign)</li>
        <li><strong>Location Targeting:</strong> United States (initial rollout)</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Budget:</strong> $10–$20 per day</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery / Bidding:</strong> Start with Maximize Clicks; transition to Maximize Conversions after sufficient data</li>
        <li><strong>Landing Page:</strong> This website and blog (product story + supporting content)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Illustrating the Google Ads Dashboard (What I Track)</h3>
      <p>
        The Google Ads dashboard supports continuous improvement through real-time reporting. I would monitor:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Impressions</strong> (visibility)</li>
        <li><strong>Clicks & CTR</strong> (relevance and engagement)</li>
        <li><strong>CPC</strong> (cost efficiency)</li>
        <li><strong>Conversions</strong> (desired outcomes such as purchases or email sign-ups)</li>
        <li><strong>Search terms report</strong> (to refine keywords and add negatives)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, I would A/B test ad copy, tighten keyword match types, improve Quality Score, and refine landing page messaging
        to increase conversion performance.
